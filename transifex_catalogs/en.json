By participating, stakeholders help secure the network by voting to approve the work of the miners, and gain voting rights on proposed changes to the Decred blockchain and project management via Politeia. For a complete explanation, see <a href=\"https://docs.decred.org/proof-of-stake/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the documentation</a>.<br /><br />Because tickets are called pseudorandomly and a wallet must be online to vote when a ticket is called, many people use a Voting Service Provider (VSP) using Decrediton or dcrwallet. VSPs lack access to your funds and are tasked with relaying your voting preferences to the network.<br /><br />The following VSPs have been reviewed by the community.",
